                            While the Awesome Mix Vol. 1 in Guardians of the Galaxy was resonant with a lot of people, it was the soundtrack in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 that improved  on the formula. The first film featured songs that were fun and upbeat but didn't have much to do with the film's story.

                            John Williams did a lot of music for many popular franchises. After his work on Star Wars, he would later do the score for Jurassic Park. This dinosaur film was full of epic shots and tense moments that were further brought to life by Williams' music.

                            When Star Wars: A New Hope was released, it introduced many iconic themes that people would recognize decades after. That was thanks to John Williams, who put together the iconic fanfare, the Imperial March, and so many more great tracks.
